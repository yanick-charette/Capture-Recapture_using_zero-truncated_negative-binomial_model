## Capture-Recapture analysis using arrest data

This R script uses a Capture-Recapture technique to estimate the population of hidden offenders (at risk of being arrested), considering the characteristics of the "captured" offenders by using a zero-truncated negative binomial multivariate model. Once the total population of offenders is estimated, risks of arrest, conviction and incarceration can then be estimated and compared by individuals' characteristics.

Results from this model will be presented in Charette & van Koppen (accepted) **A capture-recapture model to estimate the effects of extra-legal disparities on crime funnel selectivity and punishment avoidance**, *Security Journal*.
